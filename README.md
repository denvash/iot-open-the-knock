# Open The Knock

OTK is an Arduino Project made as part of **Arduino Course** @ *Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology*.

Was a nominee for the best CS-Department project  (for the current semester).

OTK is a **Knocking-Lock**, a lock which opens on a specific rhythm of knocks and a LCD screen which provides the information of the current lock state.

A challenge form is filled by the client, the form is personal and will be used as the challenges answers. To open the lock the client must successfully handle a sequence of events:

- Identification (using knocks).
- Give a right solution (by sequence of knocks) for a randomize challenge which appears on the screen.
- Upon failure a defense system is activated.
